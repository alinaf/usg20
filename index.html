                            <h3>Christine Nguyen / Miles Kaye
                            </h3>
                            <p>Christine Nguyen and Miles Kay said they’re focused on bridging the gap between the student body and USG. <br><br>
                                “There are so many amazing things that USG does to help serve the student body,” said Nguyen, a first-generation sophomore majoring in political science. “However, there’s a communication divide where a lot of students don’t know what USG is, what USG stands for and how USG actually can be a resource to them.” <br><br>
                                In the past year, Nguyen, has served as USG’s assistant director of marketing and worked with Tommy Tours. Kay, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering, served as the service director of Trojan Knights and vice president of Engineers Without Borders. <br><br>
                                The ticket plans to include school-specific mental health forums for students to discuss issues related to their major and increase student awareness by creating initiatives designed to educate the student body of available resources.  <br><br>
                                “We don’t believe that problems can be solved by throwing money at them,” said Kay. “We don’t want to just create all these new initiatives and have no one use them.”

                         <h3>Christopher McMorran / Trinity Lee
                         </h3>

                         <p>Many USC students know of USG but not what it does. Christopher McMorran and Trinity Lee hope to change that. <br><br>
                            Sen. McMorran and senate aid Lee said they aim to create communicative relationships between USG and different student organizations on campus.
                            McMorran, a junior majoring in political science and film and television production, said he sees the similarities between all the presidential platforms this year as a positive objective.<br><br>
                            “It means we are united in what needs to be fixed at USC,” McMorran said. “The question is who we think has the skills and trust to really execute the platform. You shouldn’t just look at people who are promising you things, you should look at what each candidate [has] already done.”<br><br>
                            McMorran and Lee, a freshman majoring in urban studies and planning, supervised the extension of the Transfer Forgiveness pass. The two are pushing to implement public transit subsidies, Adobe Access for all students on campus and educate people on the different types of resources the University offers.

                        <h3>Sara Khoshniyati / Rohit Bolla
                        </h3>
                        <p>Sara Khoshniyati and Rohit Bolla said their campaign aims to improve the dynamic between the student body and administrators by building upon relationships Khoshniyati developed as a USG senator.<br><br>
                            “We want to empower and protect students,” said Khoshniyati, a junior majoring in human biology. “We’ve taken the concerns that we’ve seen on campus and established six focus areas, which include academic life, student life, administrative accountability, health safety and wellness, equal opportunity and sustainability.”<br><br>
                            As a senator, Khoshniyati focused on tax-off purchases for students at USC Village, increasing the diversity of health care providers on campus and raising awareness and access to suicide hotlines on campus. She is currently working to get gender-neutral bathrooms in residential buildings.<br><br>
                            Bolla, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and economics, met Khoshniyati while working as assistant director of the Philanthropy Fund in Undergraduate Student Government. Bolla is a trip leader for the USC organization Peaks & Professors and acts as an Executive Board Member of the Economic Association.

                     <h3>Truman Fritz / Rose Ritch
                     </h3>

                     <p>For Truman Fritz and Rose Ritch, relationships are the foundation of their campaign.<br><br>
                        “We have a rooted background in partnering with other people,” said Fritz, a junior majoring in business administration. “Whether it’s with students at large or the presence of different organizations here on campus like Greek life, we really find our passion and our leverage in being able to make change on campus through those partnerships.”<br><br>
                        Fritz, who currently serves as the senior director of communications for USG, is running alongside Ritch, a current senator. The duo said their experiences in student government  helped them foster a vision for the future USG. <br><br>
                        “We call it a living, breathing vision — something that is constantly evolving as the student experience is evolving,” Ritch said. “We want to create an opportunity for students to really have their voices heard and make this a student-first university.”<br><br>
                        The two candidates said they will push to improve mental health services by increasing the number of counselors, expand physical spaces for diverse communities like the Native American Student Union and DREAMers.

                <p><span class="firstcharacter">S</span>tudent government leaders must be defined by their dynamism. On the one hand, they must act as administrators, curating and developing the larger institution to work toward various measures; on the other, they must remain activists — as grassroots and impassioned as those without an office or title, fighting equally as hard, cognizant of the same stakes. Above all, they must be able to work on behalf of the large and diverse student voice. They must seek to produce the change that is so often necessary, and yet so rarely achieved.
                    <br>
                    <br> Undergraduate Student Government presidential candidate Mai Mizuno and vice presidential candidate Brianna Bozek share a vision that prioritizes tangible, concrete action to improve student life, acknowledging the needs of the local community. Their 37 platform points comprise a litany of progressive measures including community, diversity, expansion of resources and, above all, an eye on the needs of largely forgotten student groups. After interviews, extensive research and analysis of the specifics of the impressive records of service of this year’s candidates, the Daily Trojan has decided to endorse Mizuno and Bozek to serve as next year’s USG president and vice president.
                    <br>
                    <br> The editorial board was particularly impressed by Mizuno’s passion-driven track record, her on-the-ground style of activism and engagement often emphasizing underrepresented voices and diverse student need. Her work to expand resources for lower-income and food- and housing-insecure students by partnering with the Electronic Benefits Transfer and CalFresh programs was a successful example of the manners in which student government can significantly and directly impact student experiences. In a similar vein, the Mai & Brianna ticket has emphasized sexual assault prevention and expanded resources for survivors; greater diverse representation within USG; direct collaboration with cultural assemblies; expanded access to mental and reproductive health resources; and improved resources for students to understand and manage tuition. If Mizuno applies the same efficacy, compassion and innovation to these projects as her EBT/CalFresh success, it seems certain the campus will see positive change.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The two presidential tickets share many of the same platform points. However, as the records of previous presidential administrations demonstrate, vision alone will not translate to change. It matters that the Mai & Brianna ticket boasts a record of accomplishments in student government, strong relationships with key campus leaders and experience making change alongside an administration that so often remains unwilling to address student need. Mizuno and Bozek are not only the ticket with the right vision — but also the advocates with the strength and clout to see them to fruition.
                    <br>
                    <br> With a platform thoughtfully separated into short-term and long-term goals, the Mai & Brianna ticket knows the limits of what can be accomplished in a single year. But they remain undaunted by perceived limits, and speak confidently about their plan to achieve long-term goals by extending their passion and activism into training and mentorship to guide future generations of leadership. They express a readiness to finish projects which began in previous administrations, and set the frameworks for future administrations to finish theirs.
                    <br>
                    <br> Mizuno’s nearly three-year record in student government is a reflection of her ability to guide projects to the finish line. She has collaborated with administrators to expand gender-neutral housing options, and was instrumental in planning and presenting a USG bill to provide free menstrual products in central on-campus restrooms. Personal experiences also guide crucial components of Bozek’s focus, having formerly worked as a campus tour guide and the Panhellenic Council Vice President of Service and Philanthropy. She has said her own struggles with the Engemann Health Center’s limited mental health resources have made expanding access to these services a priority of the ticket and personal passion of hers.
                    <br>
                    <br> But a particular interest of the Mai & Brianna ticket — specifically, what Mizuno cites as the inspiration behind her activism and involvement in student government — is advocacy in regard to yearly tuition hikes. The Mai & Brianna ticket is intent on demanding transparency from the administration, especially where their annual budget report is concerned. Written in unnecessarily complex financial jargon, often to obfuscate the most crucial data, these reports seem to be purposefully indecipherable to those without a background in finance. Mizuno and Bozek plan to enlist those with competency in the language to release a simplified and easily digestible version of the report, in addition to implementing and raising awareness about free financial literacy courses for student seeking to take greater control over their financial futures. Most importantly, they are committed to demanding a tuition freeze from the University — a much-needed, long-awaited change.
                    <br>
                    <br> Student needs of groups without significant financial clout or numerical representation fall by the wayside; we are, more often than not, expected to conform to newly-imposed realities such as tuition hikes and condensed resources rather than forge a path that meets our needs. But Mai & Brianna are the ticket that remains undaunted by challenges and armed with the most valuable experience; the Daily Trojan recommends that we, with the power of our collective voice, entrust Mizuno and Bozek to spearhead the way toward that future.
